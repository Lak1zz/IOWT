This tool is used to perform various tasks on a Windows computer, such as installing software and checking the system's status. To use the tool, download the source code and place it on a USB flash drive. Then, run the "WS.exe" file and ensure that the computer is connected to the internet. The tool will display information about the computer, including the uptime, CPU usage, and available RAM.

To begin using the tool, start with the "Basic Install" option. This will install Chocolatey, which is required for the tool to function properly. All scripts used by the tool are based on PowerShell and require administrator rights. When prompted, click "YES" to continue.

Once the basic installation is complete, you can run the "Windows Features" and "Windows Updates" options to install additional features and updates. Then, select one of the "Install Options" to install a predetermined set of applications for either default users or personal use. If you want to install additional applications or games, there are options available for those as well.

The tool also includes a button to view system information using the "DXDIAG" tool, and a shortcut to the "Add/Remove Programs" window to uninstall applications. There is also an option to update all installed applications and check for updates to those programs.

If you have any requests, feedback, or bug reports, you can create an issue for the developer to review.
